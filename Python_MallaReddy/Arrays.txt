Arrays in Python:

1.Array in Python can be created by importing array module. array(data_type, value_list) is used to create 
   an array with data type and value list specified in its arguments.

2. Arrays are not a built-in data structure, and therefore need to be imported via the array module in order to be used
3.The array() function takes a list as an input.

Syntax:

from array import *  
arrayName = array(typecode, [initializers])   

Commonly used type codes are listed as follows:

Code	C Type		Python Type	Min bytes
b	signed char	int		1
B	unsigned char	int		1
u	Py_UNICODE	Unicode		2
h	signed short	int		2
H	unsigned short	int		2
i	signed int	int		2
I	unsigned int	int		2
l	signed long	int		4
